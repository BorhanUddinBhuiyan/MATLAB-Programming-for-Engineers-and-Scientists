%{
> When we start MATLAB and call 'rand', it always returns the same exact
number: 0.8147 
> "Pseudo" random number generator: initialized at startupp and it
generates the exact same sequence of nmbers evey time
> Repeatability for testing the program while we are developing it : good!
> what if we want a sequence that is different from default or "truly" rand
nubmers?
  > initialize the MATLAB pesudo random number generator with the built-in
  function "rng"
